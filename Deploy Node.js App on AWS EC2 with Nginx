Perfect! Since you've already followed most of the steps, here's your **‚úÖ Final A-to-Z Checklist** combining everything ‚Äî including using **PM2**, **Nginx**, and **your EC2 Public DNS** (so no port is required).

---

## ‚úÖ Final Deployment Steps: Node.js App on EC2 with NGINX + PM2 + Public DNS

---

### ‚úÖ Prerequisites Recap

* EC2 (Amazon Linux 2 or 2023)
* Node.js app listening on port `8080`
* SSH access via `.pem` key
* NGINX installed
* Security Group open on **port 80 (HTTP)**

---

### üîÅ If Not Done Yet: PM2 Setup

Install PM2 globally:

```bash
sudo npm install -g pm2
```

Start your app with PM2:

```bash
cd /home/ec2-user/your-app-folder
pm2 start app.js --name my-app
```

Save current process list:

```bash
pm2 save
```

Enable auto-start on boot:

```bash
pm2 startup
# Copy and run the command it outputs (it will look like: sudo env PATH=...)
```

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è NGINX Config (Make Sure It's Set)

Edit NGINX config:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
```

Make sure your `http` block contains this:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name ec2-3-110-177-229.ap-south-1.compute.amazonaws.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:8080;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }
}
```

Then reload NGINX:

```bash
sudo nginx -t
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

---

### üìå Make Sure Your Node.js App Listens on `0.0.0.0`:

```js
app.listen(8080, '0.0.0.0', () => {
  console.log("Server running on port 8080");
});
```

---

### üåê Final Test URL

Now open:

```
http://ec2-3-110-177-229.ap-south-1.compute.amazonaws.com
```

‚úÖ It should load your app with **no port** in the URL.

---

### ‚úÖ Optional (but recommended)

* Attach an **Elastic IP** to keep your EC2 Public DNS from changing.
* Or buy a domain and map it to the IP using a DNS A record.

---

Let me know if you want to:

* Set up **HTTPS** using Let‚Äôs Encrypt (free SSL)
* Map a custom domain (e.g., `www.example.com`)
* Set up **auto-deploy from GitHub** (CI/CD)

I‚Äôll help you with the next step!
